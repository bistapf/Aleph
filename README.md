# Aleph ntuple production for flavour tagging 

Analysis framework for reviving and reprocessing archival **ALEPH** (LEP) data and MC using the [key4hep](https://key4hep.github.io/key4hep-doc/) stack and [FCCAnalyses](https://github.com/Apranikstar/FCCAnalyses). The repo covers the ntuple production step following the staged analyses approach in `FCCAnalyses`, as well as scripts for training the tagger. *Note: Code structure to be tiedied up in future.*

Since custom changes in FCCAnalyses core code are needed, a specific FCCAnalyses submodule, pinned to a fork ([Apranikstar/FCCAnalyses](https://github.com/Apranikstar/FCCAnalyses)), is required and included in this repo. 


## Setup

Clone the repo together with the `FCCAnalyses` submodule:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleph-flavour-lab/ntuple-production.git
cd ntuple-production
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Set up the environment (sources the pinned key4hep stack recorded in `FCCAnalyses/.fccana/stack_pin`, and configures the `FCCAnalyses` `PATH`/`PYTHONPATH`):

```bash
source setup.sh
```

Build the `FCCAnalyses` submodule (only needed once, or after pulling submodule updates or making edits to the core code yourself of course):

```bash
cd FCCAnalyses
fccanalysis build -j 8
cd ..
```

> To update the pinned stack, edit `FCCAnalyses/.fccana/stack_pin`. `FCCAnalyses/setup.sh` also accepts `-l/--latest`, `-n/--nightlies`, or `-b/--from-build` if you need a different stack than the pinned one (see `source FCCAnalyses/setup.sh --help`).

Every new shell session, just re-run `source setup.sh` from the repo root before working with `fccanalysis`.

## Repository layout

- [`src/`](src/) — Stage1 (ntuple production from raw ALEPH data/MC via `fccanalysis`) and stage2 (event-level → jet-level conversion) processing. See [src/README.md](src/README.md) and [src/stage2/README.md](src/stage2/README.md).
- [`src/training/`](src/training/) — Jet-flavour tagger training configs (`weaver`).
- [`Data_MC_plotting/`](Data_MC_plotting/) — Config-driven Data/MC comparison plotting for stage1 and inference-level ntuples. See [Data_MC_plotting/README.md](Data_MC_plotting/README.md).
- [`ROOT-Plotting/`](ROOT-Plotting/) — PyROOT-based plotting scripts. *Probably obsolete to be double checked*
- [`FCCAnalyses/`](FCCAnalyses/) — FCCAnalyses submodule (analyzers, build system, `fccanalysis` CLI).
- [`test/`](test/) — Validation datasets and scripts used to cross-check ntuple production across framework versions. *Probably obsolete to be double checked*

## Quick start

See [src/README.md](src/README.md) for how to run stage1 (on data or MC) and stage2, and [Data_MC_plotting/README.md](Data_MC_plotting/README.md) for making comparison plots from the resulting ntuples.
